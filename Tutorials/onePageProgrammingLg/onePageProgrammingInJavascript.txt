JavaScript Module Pattern: In-Depth
------------------------------------
1.Anonymous Closures
=======================
This is the fundamental construct that makes it all possible, and really is the single best feature of JavaScript. 
Weâ€™ll simply create an anonymous function, and execute it immediately. All of the code that runs inside the function lives in a 
closure, which provides privacy and state throughout the lifetime of our application.

(function () {
	// ... all vars and functions are in this scope only
	// still maintains access to all globals
}());
Notice the () around the anonymous function. This is required by the language, since statements that begin with the token function
are always considered to be function declarations. Including () creates a function expression instead.
