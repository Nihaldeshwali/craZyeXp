set autoindent    " always set autoindenting on
set copyindent    " copy the previous indentation on autoindenting
set number        " always show line numbers
set shiftwidth=2  " number of spaces to use for autoindenting
set shiftround    " use multiple of shiftwidth when indenting with '<' and '>'
set showmatch     " set show matching parenthesis
set ignorecase    " ignore case when searching
set smartcase     " ignore case if search pattern is all lowercase,
set smarttab      " insert tabs on the start of a line according to "    shiftwidth, not tabstop
set hlsearch      " highlight search terms
set incsearch     " show search matches as you type

set smartindent
set tabstop=2
set shiftwidth=2
set expandtab

"Auto insert "
inoremap {<CR> {<CR>}<C-o>O

Q3. Paste got sqied ?
==================
The best way to avoid this is to run ":set paste" before pasting, then ":set nopaste" afterwards. This will disable all formatting so that you can paste easily, then re-enable whatever you had had originally.
