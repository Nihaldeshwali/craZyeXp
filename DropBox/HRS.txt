TALL TESSERACT OCR ON UBUNTU 12.04 LTS By Marika on May 30, 2013 12:12 PM | Permalink
This is an installation guide for installing Tesseract OCR on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

First install the required libraries and tools for compiling.

sudo apt-get install libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install gcc g++
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool checkinstall
Install Leptonica from source. The latest version as of writing is 1.69.

wget http://www.leptonica.org/source/leptonica-1.69.tar.gz
tar -zxvf leptonica-1.69.tar.gz
cd leptonica-1.69
./configure
make
sudo checkinstall
sudo ldconfig
Then install Tesseract OCR from source.

wget https://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/files/tesseract-ocr-3.02.02.tar.gz
tar -zxvf tesseract-ocr-3.02.02.tar.gz
cd tesseract-ocr
./autogen.sh
./configure
make (this may take a while)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
Finally, install the languages you want. Simply place the trained data under /usr/local/share/tessdata. You can do this through wget or FTP upload.

Below are some miscellaneous notes.

If you wish to call Tesseract from PHP, try this:

shell_exec("/usr/local/bin/tesseract input.png output -l eng");
On a side note, in the rare case you are running MAMP and the above code fails, you should edit the environment variables in /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/envvars. Comment out the following lines as such:

#DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/Applications/MAMP/Library/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
#export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
