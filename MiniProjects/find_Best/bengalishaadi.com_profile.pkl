Vhiya..!!! thanks for stopping by ..!! lemme get the biodata out of the way-I am a very straightforward girl. (some people might get offended by my honesty but i can't help it). I'm very passionate about literature, reading, writing, painting,cooking, photography, old hollywood movies, music & my pets. I did my Bachelors in English Hons from Bethune College and then Masters in English literature .currently i'm preparing for the entrance exams for Ph.D (studies never end for literature lovers).my future plans are to clear NET and become a lecturer some day (sigh !!! ) . I love cooking and experimenting in the kitchen,wipping up new dishes for my parents (i use my dad's never ending hunger to my benefit).its my stress buster.I am very fond of reading classics and mystery novels (i am your average nerd-hence the specs !).I am a passionate amateur photographer.I love pets,and i have numerous of cats and dogs (people think i'm nuts)..I have a black belt in karate (my dad has a very different notion of how a girl must be bought up.) I'm the only child of my parents( have been pretty lonely). my father is Bengali, while my mother is a sikh Punjabi. I have been very lucky to receive the best of the both cultures (think about all the yummy bengali and punjabi delicacies i get to eat..!!! hehehe).My Father is an ex naval personnel,currently working as a Personal Manager and C.S.O of a reputed company.My Mother is a school teacher.Though we are a nuclear family ,we have a very large close extended family.Our family is a happy melange of mixed culture and tradition. Dictionary defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman.For me marriage is a gathering of equals rather than the subjugation of one to another..i'm looking for someone who will be my best friend, willing to stand by me through every stage of life,someone fiercely honest ,has a good sense of humour (some one who has a funny bone in em !), intelligent and who can challenge me intellectually (intelligence in a man what makes a lady drool over him not his bank balance) as i'm a die hard romantic i am looking for that special man (aka, a gentleman) who can really love me with all his heart, who treats his parents and older generation with respect..looks,status and caste are not at all important to me.I would like to be a daughter of my in laws rather than just a daughter in law.All in all i'm looking for someone as goofy and honest as me to spend the rest of my life loving him (squabbling too sometimes-makes marriage spicy !!!!! ),cooking for him and being his best friend .so if you think we are alike in perspective ,then do send me an email . If not then my best wishes for your search for your soul mate.may you find her !! Good luck..!! p.s -smokers and dowry seekers (my dad has no money) please excuse...

VHi! I am Debolina Ray from Kolkata, WB. I am doing my Masters in English and also working with K. E Carmel Group of Schools as a Faculty member. The cliched idea of an an arranged marriage in the 'parents meet parents' way freaks me out. I am posting this profile so that the 'arranged marriage' doesn't seem so arranged. I am kinda outdoor events person, I like travelling, visiting new places, trying out new activities, watching movies but I don't like eating out- I prefer take aways. I love travelling to the hill stations. Coasts don't attract me that much. If at home, I would mostly be found reading stuff- be it contemporary fiction, novella, SS or classic literature. I like trying out new recipes- I am not a fantastic cook but I am not a bad one though. I trained in the classical dance form- Bharatnatyam for a long time but now I am more into music. My family is a perfect blend of traditions and modern ideas. They are moderately liberal. I would like a partner who's simple, caring, understanding, balanced, mature and essentially family- oriented. Show offs and pompous people are strict no-nos.

VHey, I am a Chartered Accountant by profession and have done my Honours Degree from Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi. I am have been working with a multinational audit firm for over three and a half years now. I have a sister who is currently in Class 11. My father, a post-graduate in pharmacy has served for over 20 years in a FMCG multi-national company and thereafter started his own consultancy firm. My mother, a Phd in Pharmacy, has recently retired from her job in a leading pharma company. Due to my father's transferable job when I was young, I have been brought up in Baroda, Bangalore, Kolkata & Delhi NCR. We have now been staying in Gurgaon for over 5 years. As a person I am affectionate, composed and also ambitious. Having changed schools and cities multiple times, I feel it is easy for me to adapt to different environments and people. For me,spending time with family is an important part of my day. In my partner, I would like someone who is caring and respectful towards his family and my family. Also, since I would like to continue to work after marriage, I hope to have a partner who understands and appreciates the same. In my free time I like listening to music, reading and travelling. If you feel our thoughts and interests match, we can connect and get to know each other better.

V( In her own words ) Hello! I am Amrita. Lot to know about me, but time and space constraints allow me to let you know only the afore mentioned details. I secured 88% from DPS in my 10th board exams after which I went to a boarding school of Birla Foundation namely Ashok Hall Girls Residential School, Ranikhet. That part of my life was a perfect combination of fun and learning. My hobbies since then have been playing TT, reading classic and contemporary books & travelling. I have completed my BA( Hons ) in English Literature as well as MA English from Amity University, Noida. I worked in Applect learning system Pvt Ltd as a Subject Matter Expert in English for one year after completion of post graduation . That was my first job and I loved it. My company is an e- learning firm in the K-12 segment. I have done my B.Ed Regular course from IP University Delhi for the academic year 2012-13. My personality is a perfect balance between an extrovert and an introvert. I completely understand what is interdependence and yet I believe and appreciate in autonomy. I have stayed away from home for more than 10 years now yet I realise the importance of human values and believe in prioritising family relationship.My father is a very senior level Engineer in Western Coalfields Limited, Nagpur and has worked in various places in India. My family is based in Kolkata. My Grandfather hailed from a reputed family of Burdwan and was a Chief Engineer in SAIL , Bhilai.My father's elder brother is also a senior level Engineer in SAIL , Kolkata. We have our parental house at Durgapur . My maternal grandfather retired as Chief Personal Manager, presently staying at Asansol. My mother belongs to a very educated and cultured family. She is History Hons Graduate and connected with various social activities. My maternal uncle is DGM in Burnpur Steel Plant and my maternal aunt's husband retired as a Station Director at AIR Kolkata. Members of my extended family are very educated and well placed in India and in abroad. I completely believe in the institution of marriage with full faith and wish this soulmate search brings a fruitful result! Get in touch if you like my profile! :-)

VI am a PhD scholar perusing research on gender and aging studies emphasising various dimensions of public policy. After completion of my PhD I would like to join international research organisation and carry forward my research in my area of interest and need both at national and international forum. I am a single child and have been groomed with immense love, values, ideals, sophistication and career-ambitions of the most wonderful and loving parents. They have always encouraged and assisted me to achieve the best I can in my career and still motivates me in the same path. Thus as a result I have been groomed up as a very career-oriented empowered woman. At the same time I have a lot of love and interest for fine-art and culture. I am also a pretty social lady who enjoys meeting people, learning new culture and societal dimension. I thoroughly enjoy the company of intellectuals and progressive mentality. For me honesty, presentable personality, good sense of humor, confidence in own self, broad mental perspective, financial- compatibility, career-success, dignity for own self and respect of others (even the weaker) and; sensibility and maturity are the key factors for making a successful human being. I believe hardship and struggle are inseparable part of life, combating with them and making the journey smoother depends on the quality of a human character. I have a dream of interacting as many different culture as possible around the world and to be remembered for contributing successfully in designing a more effective public policy of developing nations through my research. I value as much for honour and respect from the fellow compatriots for honest hard-work, as I do for financially and socially stable and enjoyable life.

She is known to be a sweet, charming, jovial, caring, friendly, family oriented and rational with high cultural values and etiquette.She is pretty easy to get along with, generally a happy and cheerful human being and like to be around people and mingle with them. She is educated, smart and modern enough to establish a good status in the society. And I feel proud to announce that my ward can adjust in any kind of environment and she has a good talent to sustain and keep herself happy along with the people surrounding her in any situation Hence, I am searching a groom for my child who should be able to be with her always supporting her and giving immense love and care. But at the same time he should be qualified and good in culture. And last but not the least should be good in personality,simple, loving, caring and highly communicable and sociological. So that not only with Debosmita, but also with our family he can adhere. As we belong to a small, liberal, educated, modern, cultural and etiquette rich family, we are highly sociological and communicable resulting in a good reputation in the society. We are god fearing. We give education and humanity the first priority. After all service to man is service to god.

VI belong to a liberal modern family with strong ethics. I have completed my engineering from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar and was placed in TCS through campus in 2011. I have always been into extra curricular activities have had participated in almost every event in school and college. I love reading books, watching American sitcoms, movies, travelling. As a person I would describe myself as confident, balanced, friendly at the same time I am emotional.I enjoy meeting new people. I love dancing. I study everything and anything "pretty religiously". I also have a relentless passion for all genre's of music. I guess that stems from my love of dancing. I love anything with great beat. I love sports especially Table Tennis and badminton.I very much enjoy helping the needy or the unprivileged and in distant future would love to associate myself with a NGO, I have been associated with SIFE in college days. I have a nuclear family which comprises of my mother, father & sister, but we are extremely close to our distant relatives or extended family. My father is into business, mother a homemaker and my younger sister is pursuing BBA-LLB from KIIT University. I belong to an upper-middle class family, our is a reputed family of Odisha we are staying here for the last 23 years. We originally belong to Bankura in West Bengal. My father is a self made man, he has made it big with his hard work and never die attitude. I have always been into sports and managed to bring a few laurels to my family. I love travelling. I am more happy with the little things that life bestows on us. I love making friends. I am very close to my family, they are the most integral part of me. I believe that trust, honesty and open conversation from both sides are the key factors to shape and make a relationship successful. I am looking for someone who is ready to make this effort with me and make relationship and life close to perfect. Life is short - what you want from it is what you get and "I despise living a mundane/routine life". Having said that, I believe in having an upbeat lifestyle that's pepped up with distinct passions (mine and potentially yours) to make some unique experiences. That makes work-life balance an absolute necessity for me and in a way expect the same from my significant other - 'coz it takes two to tango! What exactly I am looking for is.. My ideal partner will be someone who is confident, someone who believes in family values. I am looking for a positive person and who has the spirit to take up challenges & overcome them. Understanding & taking care of each other is key to happy marriage is what I believe in. P.S.- Good luck with your hunt for the best!! :)

VHi, Let me Introduce myself,,, My name is Rupasree Das, Presently I am stayed in siliguri with my family, In my family there is my mom dad, and my 2 younger brother nd 2 younger sister.My father is doing a small business of wooden furniture nd my mom is housewife.1 of my younger brother is completed BCOM in 2013, nd another 1 is in class 8, one of my sister is now on 1st year and another 1 is in class 12. Now its time to say about me, I am simple & very much imotional, My friends described me as cute and jolly type, I have completed my 12th exam on 2006 after that I hv started working and started to support my family, presently I hv leave my job and again started my dropped study. I love to smiling, spend time with frnds and family, Surfing internet. I love dreaming but my dreams are not too big, I always dream about a happy family, my needs are also not so big I jst only need a loving and caring husband who loves me lot and a family who trusts me most. If I say that money does not matter for me then its not be fully wright bcoz money matters, without money we cannot lead a life so it matters partialy but only that much which is needed to fullfil our requirements. I belive that we always run for a better lifestyle but for that we missed the happy moments of our life. Once we missed the moments they never come back again, my thinking is not too much worry abt future jst live the present. I think that I have the ability to face any situation and I can win hearts ,,, and I can say it confidently that nobody cannot be angry on me for long time. I love Choclates,Ice-Cream nd PapriChat, my fav drink is Lemon water, I know cooking little bit. Ibaku hate cigarate and tambaku n gutkha's smell, its irritates me so much. I dont need too much attention but I need only the one person with whom I can spend my whole life, & I know I can find him 1 day bcoz I want it from the bottom of my heart,,,,, till then I am waiting for my Mr. Perfect.

VI am Priyanka's father,posting this profile on behalf of my daughter who is a Fashion Designer by profession and is associated with a leading Retail Organisation in Bangalore. Since, I was associated with the Tea Industries all through my career and being posted in Assam and Mizoram, my daughter has completed her schooling from Assam. My Wife is a Housewife and our family Comprises of the three of us. Priyanka had been a very creative person since childhood. She had a major interest in Painting, Crafting and anything related to Creativity. She had been a good student throughout her school-life and since then,it was her dream to become a Fashion Designer when she grows up. She is very determined and focussed on what she wants to do and we had always extended our full-fledged support towards her decisions and efforts. She graduted in Fashion Designing from one of the most premier Institutes in Fashion with her own potentiality. She had been a scholarship holder all through four years in College. She is passionate about her work and have been very successful in her career. She is a self-made woman who has struggled and achieved whatever she wanted in a very short period of time. As a person, my daughter is a very Kind-hearted person, gives a lot of importance to family values, loves the people in her life unconditionally, be it friends or family. She is well-behaved and well-cultured, knows to balance between her work and relations. She is self-dependant and at the same time, little emotional. She has an interest in cooking since a very small age and is an amazing cook. She has a love for Travelling and Photography. She spends her leisure time in watching movies, writing and painting. She is hard-working and very less demanding and believes to achieve things with her own efforts. She is understanding and knows to respect others' thoughts and views. As a father, I would prefer my son-in-law to be someone who is self-dependant, matured, qualified in his own field and who can take care of my daughter and stand beside her all throughout her life. Someone who is able to understand her and support her as her best friend. Since, we don't have a son, so, would prefer our son-in-law to be more a son to us. I believe, marriage is not only a relation between the girl and the boy, it's creating a relation between two families. We belong to a well-cultured family with liberal views and would prefer to be associated with a like-minded family for our daughter.
