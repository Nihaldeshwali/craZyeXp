 <p>Is your array have any Duplicates ? </p> 

</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>You are given an integer array. You need to find out if the array contains any duplicates. </h1> 

<h2>Work out some examples !<h2>
<h3>
How complex the problem is, excesing the problem with example helps a lot to understand the problem better! To make this problem more clear let consider the follwoing example.
<ul> 
<li><b>Example 1 :</b> You are given a below array {1,2,3,4,5}. All the element in the array occur only once. hence the result will be "No Duplicates" </li>
<li><b>Example 2:</b> Now consider this array {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. In this arry element 1 is occure twice at the begining and at the end , hence it will say "Duplicate Found"</li>
</ul>
</h3>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Ask Question to interviewers !<h2>
<h3> Before writing any solution of the problem or writing the code, it's very important to understand the problem first. You should ask questions to the interviewer to make sure you understand the problem throughly, For this problem, you migh ask the following questions:
<ul>
<li><b>Q1: Is the array is sorted ?</b> No! We have a random array of interger: Not necesary to be sorted! </li>
<li><b>Q2: What if Multiple element repeated twice ?</b> Yes! it's possible, There is no restrictuon on how many Elemnet  Should  occure how many times. If there exist a element having more then once , you shoud report "Duplicat found"</li>
<li><b>Q3: May I use extra space ?</b> No! Let's try it without using any extra space!</li>
</ul>
</h3>
</div> 
<div class="section">
<h2>Start with a obvious solution !</h2>
<h3>How hard the problem is, there will be always a dummy solution ! It might be worst one, it might have worst time complexity, it might looks like a easy and dump, but you should start with this! Later you will explore different technique to improve this. <br>
For this Problem, it also have a native way to solve this.Here is how: 
<ul>
<li>Scan the array from left to right and pick-up an element at a time.</li>
<li>Compare this item with other elements to verify whether they are same or not!</li>
<ul><li>If we found they are same!, we know the duplicate exist for that elemnt - hence print "Duplicate Found".</li></ul>
<li>When we complete the processing for all the elements and no such dupliacte elements found, we can certainly conclude that the array contains no dupliacte.</li>
</ul></h3>
<h2>Design the Algorithms</h2>
<h3> Once you understand the solution properly, you are able to write the algorithm in pseduo code. This will help to mathematically formulate the problem, which will be useful at the time of coding. The Algorithm <b>MUST</b> states the input and output ,followed by a finite well-defined steps to solve the problem.<br>The Algorithm for this problem is stated below:

<div class="cb">Input : A[1..N]
Output: True/False
Step1: For i :=1 to N 
   Step 1.1: For j = i+1 to N
     if A[i] same as A[j] => print "Duplicate Found" and return
Step2: Print "No Duplicates" 
</div>
<h2> write the code </h2>
<div class="cb"> /* Write your code here */
</div>
<h2> Derive the Complexity! </h2>
<h3><b>What is the time complexity of this problem ? </b>O(n^2) - This is because we picked up each element and compare with all the elements in right side of this. thus For first element we need N comparism , For second elemnt it need n-1 comparisn and so on. Thus total comparrism require is N+(N-1)+(N-2)+...+1 = O(n^2)
<br><b>What is the space complexity for this problem? </b> It's O(1), As we are not using any space other than loop veraibles ( Which takes constact space), which depends on input size. </h3>
