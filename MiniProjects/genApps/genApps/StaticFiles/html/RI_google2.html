 <h1> Any Anagram Substring</h1> 
</div>

<div class="section">
<!---------------------  START ---------------------->

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<h3> There was a time, when we are happy by searching a string into another string. But sometime it is require to search by "permutation", That means a search is said to be successful if any permutation of a string can be a sub-string of another string. Some time is is required! </h3>

<h3>For example, we want to build a search engine, which basically returns a text based search result. My servers store lot of text documents(pages). When ever we search a string, it should return only those pages, which contains the string. People might not write the same sentence but putting the order in different permutation. Any page having taht permutation of search string should be returned.
<br>
<b>In a Nut sell, Given two strings A and B, find whether any anagram of string A is a sub-string of string B. For example: if A = xyz and B = "abczyxpq" then the program should return true.</b>

</h3>

<h2>Solution1: Basic solution first!</h2>
A simple solution is like this:

<h6>Step1: Find all permutation of A
Step2: For each permutation , find if it a sub string of B or not ! If yes return true.
Step3: Return False if step 2 fails.
</h6>

<b>What is the complexity of this problem ?<b><br>
<h3>We assume length of A is N and Length of B is M.(that means the string is A[1..N] and B[1..M]) We can have total N! number of permutation of A and for each permutation the search in B require O(M*N) time. hence total complexity would be O(N*N!*M). Space complexity is O(1)<br>

can we improve the complexity ? Yes! We can improve it by using some extra space.
<h3>

<h2>Solution2: Tricky Solution with O(n) </h2>
<h3>
When we are talking about the anagram , we are interested in the frequency of character, not on how they are aligned in the string. Thus "aabc" and "abca" are same to me when I am thinking about anagram. Next question would be: how can we represent an anagram ? Using a hash MAP of size 255.  Thus we can build a frequency map, say MAP[255], from input A. where map[i] indicate how many time the charterer "i"" appears in array A. Any sub-string of array B contains the same frequency, is the solution. <br>

Now, we are ready to scan Array B from left to right. We also need an another map, which is used to keep track the frequency occurrence in Array B. Say TargetMAP[255]. Initially we copy the TARGET_MAP[] from MAP[], when we scan charterer "c" we will decrement the count for TARGET_MAP["c"], thus when all element in TARGET_MAP[] is Zero, we conclude that we found the sub string. <br>

<b>Now with this algorithm, we have some important question to address? </b>
<ol>
<li> What happen if we get a char , which is not present in A ( taht is MAP[i] =0)? We sould restart the process by copying MAP[] to TARGET_MAP[].
</li><li>What happen if we receive over occurrence ? Ex. serach "abaa" in "ababaac" ? In this case we TARGET_MAP[i] try to get negative ? in this case we should move to next position, as we cannot consider that char.
</li></ol>

<b>Thus We are actually moving a Window over string B </b>- which has left and right pointer. 
1 We are moving right if TARGET_MAP[B[right]] > 0 and we need the character
2 We srink the window at left, when TARGET_MAP[B[right]] trying to get Negative, we shroud move the left unto a point when we can exclude the left occurrence.
3. We will discard the window if some thing non-intended occurs . that is MAP[i] is -1;


In NutShell, the algorithm is as below:
</h3>
<h6>
INPUT : A[1..N], B[1...M]
OUTPUT: True / False
Step 1. Scan array A and build a frequency map MAP[0..255], if something not occured assign to -1;
Step 2. Build TARGET_MAP[] copy from MAP[]
Step 3. Scan Array B from left to right, say idx is the current index,.
  Step 3.1. if TARGET_MAP[B[idx]] > 0 , expand the right window and decrement the occurenace
  Step 3.2. if TARGET_MAP[B[idx]] ==0, srink at left, until TARGET_MAP[B[idx]] become +ve and then decremnt the occurece
  Step 3.3  if TARGET_MAP[B[idx]] == -1, got a wrong chrecter, Restart the process by coping.
Step 4. if all element of TARGET_MAP[] is Zero: found sub-string
Step 5. repeat Step 3,4 until we process all character in Array B

<h3>
Complexity : Time Complexity is O(N)+O(M)*O(255)
Space Complexity is O(2*256)
</h3>
<h2>Solution 3: Some Improvements! </h2>
<h3>
Let's ans the following question:
<ol>
<li>Q. In each step in Scanning, we need to check if all element is become zero of not ! it;s require a loop of O(255), How can you remove this ? We can remove this ALLZERO check by tracking the length of windows, if window size become of legth N, which means windows contains all char frequency, we got the solution.

</li><li>Q. How can you remove the TARGET_MAP[]? Yes it is possible to do using one map. Whenever we expand the window on right side, we are decrementing MAP[] value and whenever we shrinking at left, we increase that map index.

</li><li>Q. how can you discard the copy operation when we got a un-wanted character ?
- When We received the unwanted character srick at left unto the next character of un-wanted character and keep updating the MAP count.
</li></ol>
The modified Algorithm is as below:
</h3>
<h6>
INPUT : A[1..N], B[1...M]
OUTPUT: True / False
Step 1. Scan array A and build a frequency map MAP[0..255], if something not occured assign to -1;
Step 2. Initially window left and widow right at -1
Step 3. Scan Array B from left to right, say idx is the current index,.
  Step 3.1. if MAP[B[idx]] > 0 , expand the right window and decrement the occurenace
  Step 3.2. if MAP[B[idx]] ==0, srink at left, until MAP[B[idx]] become +ve and then decremnt the occurece
  Step 3.3  if TARGET_MAP[B[idx]] == -1, got a wrong charterer, srink at left untill we come accross this wrong ele
Step 4. if window length == N return ans
Step 5. repeat Step 3,4 until we process all character in Array B
