- A beginning of craZY Experiment of Dipankar ...


Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess, who wanted to store all his ornaments in a common place, which is easy to acess, easy to show case and easy to repair.

The princess first tried all manner of Open Repository, but found them broken, or slow, or not unicode compliant, or plain just didn't work with her thoughts.

"This totally bites," said the princess. "I need like four commands and I don't want to make my own ornaments library."

She then discovered gitHub had excellent documentation on its jewellery store services with full wokring Agent(api).

"Bitchin," said the princess, who had watched too many 80s movies recently. "I'll just make jewellery instead."

So she did, and it worked, and there was much feasting and celebration, followed by a royal battle with accounting over what constituted reasonable mead expenses.

And everybody lived happily ever after.

THE END
