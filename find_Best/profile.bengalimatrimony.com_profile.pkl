VI would describe my niece as a girl full of life and zest. She is a balanced person with the right mix of being traditional, cultured as well as having a broad outlook towards life. She loves writing, especially Hindi poems with a gist of funny element added to it. Her main interest are writing funny political article, poems using computer languages and jargon.She was the editor of her college magazine during her under graduation and have won appreciation for her mimic articles.Her this part of wittiness and sense of humor explains her big social friend circle, and that would also explain her talkative nature. She loves traveling and is a fitness freak. She has been a classical Bharatnatyam dancer and has been practicing yoga for nearly a decade now.She has been actively involved in the one of the national club during her graduation period of 2 year here in USA.She has also been participating actively in all the cultural shows organized in her university. About her cooking skills, I would say she must have started cooking only after she came to USA, and had no other option but to cook for herself, but surprisingly she found a very decent cook in herself and cooks very good desserts and cakes. So to summarize I would say my daughter is a cultured, hardworking, independent, smart,disciplined and witty person. We are looking for a boy who is traditional yet with the right mix of being modern. Wavelength matching between the two individual is more important to the girl.
